% Function to compute the average number of transmissions based on rate R1, SNR, e, and HARQ rounds M
% Replace the body of this function with the appropriate calculations from the paper
function N = compute_avg_transmissions(R1, snr, e, M)
    % Example calculation using a hypothetical relationship
    % This should be replaced with the actual relationship from the paper
    % As the SNR increases, the expected number of transmissions might decrease due to better channel conditions
    % Here we use a simple inverse relationship for demonstration
    N = log(1/e) / (snr * R1 * M); % This is just a placeholder and not based on real equations
